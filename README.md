# DRL_Navigation_Thesis
Summary: A repository that keeps track on my thesis work on implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework for the navigation of a MRS without the need of a map; RTAB-Map is used to generate maps (2D occupancy maps, 3D point clouds, 3D octamaps).

This work is mainly inspired and based on the repository (reiniscimurs/DRL-robot-navigation): https://github.com/reiniscimurs/DRL-robot-navigation
The repository is divided in 2 worspaces:
1. DRL-robot-navigation (which is cloned from the above repository): the steps to take into consideration to launch the DRL training/testing is mentioned in the worspace's README.txt
2. model_test: this workspace is where I am experimenting, based on the first workspace's framework, the uses of the trained model - especially in the case of a MRS.
